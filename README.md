# Hey there, I'm Rajsv Mahendra 👋

Welcome to my corner of the internet — part digital workshop, part scribbled notebook, and part time machine

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm not just a student — I'm a curious mind, a builder of ideas, and a seeker of the "why" behind the "how."  
When I’m not writing code, I’m probably rewriting it… because perfection is a moving target, isn’t it?

Currently diving deep into:
- 🧠 Machine Learning & AI
- 🌐 Web Development
- 🧪 Side experiments that may or may not destroy the universe

> “I believe in learning from first principles — not just using the hammer, but knowing how it’s forged.”

## 🚀 Featured Projects

A few things I’ve built or contributed to:

- 🔍 [Project Name 1](#) – A short 1-liner that makes people curious.
- 🤖 [AI Toy Project](#) – Maybe it doesn’t change the world, but it sure tried.
- 📊 [Mini Dashboard](#) – I like making data talk.

(Working on new ones constantly — watch this space!)
